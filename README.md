Student Summary Report

This repository contains a simple static summary report for the provided student_data.csv. It is intended to be deployed on GitHub Pages (or opened locally).

Files included:
- index.html  -- Main HTML report (entry point). Shows dataset summary, top students, grade distribution, and a preview table.
- style.css   -- Simple styling for the page.
- sample.png  -- Logo image (attached separately / provided by user).

Important:
- The histogram image (histogram.png) is expected to be present in the same directory as index.html. The histogram image was generated by the analysis step from the Average column in student_data.csv. If you used the provided run_code_in_temp step, a file named histogram.png was created and should be uploaded into the repo root (same folder as index.html).

How to use:
1. Ensure the following files are in the repository root (same folder): index.html, style.css, sample.png, histogram.png
2. Open index.html in a browser or enable GitHub Pages for the repository (branch: main or gh-pages) to serve the page.

Notes:
- The summary values (mean, min, max, grade counts, top 5 students) are precomputed from the supplied student_data.csv used during analysis.
- If you update student_data.csv and want the histogram regenerated, run a small Python script to produce histogram.png; the analysis step used matplotlib to create an 8-bin histogram of the Average column.

If you want, I can also provide the Python script used to generate histogram.png so you can recreate it locally.
